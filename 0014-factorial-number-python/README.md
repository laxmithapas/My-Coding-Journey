# 13. Factorial of a Number (While Loop)

This program calculates the factorial of a number using a while loop.

## Example

**Input:**  
Enter a number: 5

**Output:**  
Factorial of 5 is 120

## How it works

- The program asks the user to enter a number.
- It starts with `factorial = 1`.
- Then it uses a while loop to multiply numbers from the given number down to 1.
- The final factorial value is displayed after the loop ends.

**Note:**  
Factorial of 0 is always 1.
